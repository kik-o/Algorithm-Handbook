# Hints

The first element in an array is always going to be unique. This means that we can place our pointers at the second index place of our array.

Don't forget that arrays are passed via reference which means the caller will be made aware of any changes you make to the input array. Also remember that we don't need to worry about what gets cut off after length. Use this info, along with the two pointer technique, to make an attempt at this algorithm.
