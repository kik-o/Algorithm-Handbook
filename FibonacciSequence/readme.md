# Fibonacci Sequence ‚ûø

## Question / Constraints üí≠

Given a number N return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence, where the sequence is:

`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

After a quick look, you can easily notice that the pattern of the sequence is that each value is the sum of the 2 previous values, that means that for N=5 ‚Üí 2+3 or in maths:

`F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
